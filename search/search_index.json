There is a dummy data set containing personal information. This data is synthetic, it does not represent, nor was it built based upon real people. Your challenge is to calculate the mean height of the sample and prepare that result to be extracted from the environment. Along the way you might notice some of the restrictions of working in a trusted research environment. You may also need to solve some common problems data scientists frequently encounter. Guide Here are some instructions to point you in the right direction and prompts for things to consider as you work. Find the data In a Data Safe Haven environment the input data is located at /input . Can you modify the input data in-place? Can you remove the data from the environment? Inspect the data What tools do you want to use? Can you install any packages you want to use? What units do you think the height values are in? Is there anything usual about the heights? Determine the mean height What tools do you want to use? Can you install any packages you want to use? Can you make a modifiable, working copy of the data? Will you write your analysis as a script or work interactively? Can you make your analysis reproducible? Prepare your result for extraction In a Data Safe Haven environment data in /output can be considered for removing from the environment. How will store your result so it can be removed? What if you wanted to also remove your analysis? Does your analysis reveal any sensitive information about the input data?","title":"Challenge"},{"location":"challenge/#challenge","text":"","title":"Challenge"},{"location":"challenge/#introduction","text":"This is a example task to give a brief impression of when a trusted research environment may be used and the flow of working with Data Safe Haven.
